LZ77 Steganography
==

LZ4 and Snappy are two high speed compression algorithms based on LZ77 of
Lempel and Ziv. They use no entropy coding so steganography based on their
backreference/match redundancy is easy and completely transparent to users of
the compressed cover.

lz4steg.py implements a steganography algorithm for LZ4, snappysteg.py is the
same but for Snappy. The below description is for the LZ4 version but the other
one works just the same.


Requirements
--

- python 2.7 or pypy (recommended for speed)
- optional: snappy and/or lz4 from PyPI (if you want to compress and compare)


Usage
--

./lz4steg.py FILE

Scans an lz4 compressed file for steganographic storage, reporting some numbers.
The relevant number is the number of bytes "stored", which is what the below
commands can store into the file (less one for NULL).


./lz4steg.py -m MESSAGE FILE

Stores the message given into the file, writing the modified file to stdout.
You can supply an output file with the -o switch. The message is stored NULL
terminated, so it should not contain a zero byte.


./lz4steg.py -d FILE

Decodes the stored message from the file, writing it to stdout. The message is
assumed to be NULL terminated, so if you've stored binary data you may only see
a part of the message.
